# Yandex-ML-Trainings
In this repository you can see some of project, which includes ML algorithms written from scratch &amp; other interesting ML tasks that I've done during Yandex ML Trainings.

## Week 1: 
* kNN algorithm vector realisation from scratch
* Build a class for Laplace distribution

## Week 2: 
* Loss function and regularization methods implementation
* Power iteration method (eigenvalue algorithm)

## Week 3: 
* BaggingRegressor from scratch & OOB score
* BoostingRegressor from scratch with MSE loss
* Solving MNIST dataset with precision on holdout set > 92%

## Week 4: 
* Feature importances vol.1 (estimation feature importances for Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting using several methods)
* Feature importances2 vol.2 (Using SHAP to explain trees ensemble solution)
